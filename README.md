# nlp-topic-modeling
Among the tasks that Natural Language Processing solves the most important ones are:

- machine translation is the first classic task assigned to the developers of NLP-technologies (it is necessary to note that it is not yet solved at the necessary level of quality for today);
- grammar and spell checking – as a conclusion of the first task;
- text classification – definitions of text semantics for further processing (one of the most popular tasks to date);
- named-entity recognition (NER) – definition and selection of entities with a predefined meaning (used to filter text information and understand general semantics);
- summarization – the text generalization to a simplified version form (re-interpretation the content of the texts);
- text generation – one of the tasks that are used to build AI-systems;
- topic modeling –  technique for extracting hidden topics from large text volumes.
